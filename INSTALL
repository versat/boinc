To build the BOINC client software:

    ./configure --disable-server

When building application that should run on BOINC, you no longer need to care about building BOINC libraries for every platform.
you can build and install BOINC libraries using [vcpkg](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg/) dependency manager:

    git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg.git
    cd vcpkg
    ./bootstrap-vcpkg.sh
    ./vcpkg integrate install
    ./vcpkg install boinc

The BOINC port in vcpkg is kept up to date by Microsoft team members and community contributors. If the version is out of date, please [create an issue or pull request](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg) on the vcpkg repository.
